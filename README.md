# Words Predictor

The main program will take a .txt file as an input, pick random word from the file, and generates all words with the highest probability of appearence from the picked word. Probabilities are measured by the words' weight and the weights are calculated from the words' appearance in the file.

Run on CMD:
```
python main.py
```

<strong>Note that reading a file of paragraph/poem is different with reading the song lyrics.</strong> You might have to modify a few lines of code in main.py file.
